# OptEEmAL-SPARQLConstructs
## Introduction
This repository includes a set of SPARQL queries that enable to transform the data of BIM models in the IFC4 STEP format to the SimModel specification in RDF format.

## Usage
You can implement a routine to process SPARQL queries using some of the existing libraries (Jena, DotNetRDF, etc.) depending on the programming language you prefer (Java, C #, etc.).

- Apache Jena Library: https://jena.apache.org/download
- DotNetRDF library: https://www.dotnetrdf.org/

## Test files
This repository contains some test files used to check the result of the data transformations carried out through the SPARQL Construct queries. You can find these files in the 'tests' folder. Note that these are tests performed with BIM models exported to IFC following the OptEEmAL guide. You can check the guide using the following link:
[BIM Guidelines](https://www.opteemal-project.eu/files/guidelines_for_opteemal_bim_input_files_v11.pdf)
